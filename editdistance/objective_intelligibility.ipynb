    "## Objective Intelligibility Assessment by Automated Segmental and Suprasegmental Listening Error Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "```Problem:``` Two measurements of intelligibility assessment; subjective and objective. The former is preferred over the latter that uses transcript scroing. In objective intelligbility assessment approach that is based on perceptual error analysis, most studies use measurments of word of phoneme errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "```Proposal:``` This study presents a family of algorithms to extract not only phoneme recognition errors but also word segmentation errors by automatically analyzing listener transcripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Participants:``` 73\n",
    "\n",
    "```Stimuli:``` 80 phrases: composed of 6 syllables that create 3 to 5 mono- and di-syllabic words. The phrases alternate strong/weak syallbic stress in either trochaic or iambic stress patterns to facilitate lexical boundary error analysis. "
