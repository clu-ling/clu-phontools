<h1>Weighted Edit Distance<h1>
<p>This is the old code where we were trying to develop a weighted edit distance<p>

<h1>Objective Intelligibility<h1>
<p>This is a summary of the paper (Objective Intelligibility Assessment by Automated Segmental and Suprasegmental Listening Error Analysis). Two things:<p>

1. Do they have the code for their proposed algorithm?
2. If not, it seems that it is the same idea to code an edit distance that decomposes the three operations (deletion, insertion and substitution).ls
